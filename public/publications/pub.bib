   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity has been suggested as a possible risk factor for a more severe course of COVID-19; however, conclusive evidence is lacking and few studies have investigated the role of BMI as a risk factor for admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. We retrospectively analyzed a COVID-19 cohort recruited during the first 40 days of the epidemic in Italy. We examined the association between obesity and 30-day mortality, admission to ICU, mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Demographic, clinical and outcome data were retrospectively analyzed in 331 patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital between 21 February and 31 March 2020. The predictive effect of obesity on mortality was assessed using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model, its effect on ICU admission and mortality in the ICU using logistic regressions, and its effect on length of hospital stay using a linear regression. Seventy-four of 331 patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m(2). Among obese patients, 21 (28.4%) required admission in ICU and 25 died (33.8%). After controlling for sex, age, comorbidities and clinical data, obesity was not significantly associated with mortality, mortality in ICU and length of hospital stay. The effect of obesity on ICU admission remained significant after controlling for sex, age, interstitial lung disease, heart disease and serum C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to ICU than non-obese patients. However, there were no significant differences in mortality between the two groups.},

   abstract = {Prevention and treatment of chronic post-surgical pain should be based on the early identification of patients at risk. The presence of a deficit in executive functions, along with the presence of psychological risk factors, could impair the use of appropriate pain coping strategies and might facilitate the transition to chronic post-surgical pain. A longitudinal cohort study was implemented. Patients listed for orthopaedic surgery were enrolled. Variables measured before surgery were pain intensity, the sensory, affective, cognitive and mixed components of pain, state and trait variables associated with the psychological status of the patient, fear of movement, pain catastrophizing, visual attention and cognitive flexibility. Pain intensity and the components of pain were re-evaluated after surgery and after three months. A linear mixed model was used to assess the predictors of pain intensity, and a multivariate linear mixed model was used to assess the predictors of the pain components. 167 patients were enrolled. Controlling for sex, age, pain duration and surgical procedure, catastrophizing and visual attention were predictors of pain intensity at follow-up. The sensory component of pain was predicted by state anxiety, healthcare-related fears, pain catastrophizing and visual attention. Anxiety and catastrophizing were predictors of the affective and evaluative components of pain. The mixed component of pain was predicted by state anxiety, healthcare-related fears and pain catastrophizing. Executive functions, along with psychological risk factors, shape the course of post-surgical pain. The efficacy of preventive and rehabilitation treatment could be possibly enhanced if these factors are treated.},

   abstract = {Knowledge about psychological and psychosocial predictors of chronic postsurgical pain is important to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes. The objective of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to assess the effect of such predictors. A comprehensive search of the available literature on this topic was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and PsycInfo. Estimates of the effect of each predictor were extracted, and both a narrative synthesis and a quantitative synthesis of these estimates were performed. Multiple imputation was used to take into account the effect of nonsignificant estimates in case they were not reported by original studies. From a sample of 8322 records, 83 articles were included in the narrative synthesis and 41 studies were used to perform the meta-analyses. The narrative synthesis showed that evidence about the effect of psychological predictors is heterogeneous, with few expected predictors, such as optimism, state anxiety and psychological distress, consistently associated with chronic postsurgical pain. By contrast, the meta-analyses showed that state anxiety, trait anxiety, mental health, depression, catastrophizing and, to a lesser extent, kinesiophobia and self-efficacy have a weak but significant association with chronic postsurgical pain. In conclusion, this study showed that psychological predictors have a significant association with chronic postsurgical pain and that state anxiety is the most explicative one. Corresponding author.

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on health care systems, increasing the risks of psychological distress in health professionals. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of burnout and psychopathological conditions in health professionals working in a health institution in the Northern Italy, and to identify socio-demographic, work-related and psychological predictors of burnout.Methods: Health professionals working in the hospitals of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano were asked to participate to an online anonymous survey investigating socio-demographic data, COVID-19 emergency-related work and psychological factors, state anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms and burnout. Predictors of the three components of burnout were assessed using elastic net regression models.Results: Three hundred and thirty health professionals participated to the online survey. Two hundred and thirty-five health professionals (71.2%) had scores of state anxiety above the clinical cutoff, 88 (26.8%) had clinical levels of depression, 103 (31.3%) of anxiety, 113 (34.3%) of stress, 121 (36.7%) of post-traumatic stress. Regarding burnout, 107 (35.7%) had moderate and 105 (31.9%) severe levels of emotional exhaustion; 46 (14.0%) had moderate and 40 (12.1%) severe levels of depersonalization; 132 (40.1%) had moderate and 113 (34.3%) severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Predictors of all the three components of burnout were work hours, psychological comorbidities, fear of infection and perceived support by friends. Predictors of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were female gender, being a nurse, working in the hospital, being in contact with COVID-19 patients. Reduced personal accomplishment was also predicted by age.Conclusions: Health professionals had high levels of burnout and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 emergency. Monitoring and timely treatment of these conditions is needed.},
